# Gauss Algorithms

The Gauss Algorithms have been developed for use in analyzing gamma-ray spectra
and are available as a library of compiled functions. They can be used to develop
spectroscopy systems for nuclear research, waste management, national security, and
other application areas.

This project is supported by [Idaho National Laboratory](https://www.inl.gov/).

An older, no longer supported version of this library implemented purely in native C is available at [https://github.com/idaholab/GaussAlgorithms](https://github.com/idaholab/GaussAlgorithms).

## HISTORY

This venerable software has been in continuous use and production here at Idaho National Laboratories since 1963 giving it one of the oldest software pedigrees there is. We are proud to make this freely available to the public and provide a brief history of its major releases, both as a standalone library (this release) or as part of a larger application.
