	Instructions for Gauss Algorithms        (6/28/2017)


These are general instructions for compiling and using the
Gauss Algorithms library in either the C/C++ or the Java
program language.


For Java programming:

    Information can be found in GaussAlgorithms-javadoc.jar.
	Insights may be gained by browsing gaussman.pdf.
	
	To create GaussAlgorithms.jar:
	1. Download Apache Commons Math 3.3.
	2. Download Java 8 SDK.

	
For C/C++ programming:

    First construct GaussAlgorithms.jar, because the C code is a
	JNI wrapper of this jar.

    To compile the Gauss Algorithms library, set paths to the Java
	JNI include files and library. Browse this textual Visual Studio
	configuration file for hints:
	  "C Source\GaussAlgs DLL\GaussAlgs DLL.vcxproj"

	To use the Gauss Algorithms DLL:
    1. Browse "C Source\GaussAlgs DLL\GaussAlgsLib.h".
	2. Browse gaussman.pdf.
	3. Browse the C source code for the example test program
	   located in "C Source\GaussAlgs Test DLL".
	
	To use the test program:
	1. First build the executable.
	2. Add the locations of the JVM and the Gauss Algorithms DLL
	   to your runtime path. The locations will be something like:
	   for the JVM: "<insert Java SDK location>\jre\bin\client"
	   for the Gauss Algorithms DLL: "C Source\GaussAlgs DLL\Debug"
	3. Launch the executable, passing in two arguments in this order:
	    a. "java class path"
		b. "filename of spectrum"
		where the java class path might look something like:
		"c:\user\<you>\GaussAlgs\lib\GaussAlgorithms.jar;c:\user\<you>\commons-math3-3.3\commons-math3-3.3.jar"
		and the filename of spectrum might look something like:
		"c:\user\<you>\GaussAlgs\test\PGNAA_antifreeze.Chn"
	4. Browse the example batch file "test\launchGaussTemplate.bat" for hints.
